Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model is trained using a labeled dataset of emails and leverages the RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn library for prediction.

Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable system to detect spam emails automatically. Spam detection is a common use case for text classification tasks in the field of machine learning. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of labeled emails, with each email categorized as either spam or ham. The dataset includes features such as the subject, body content, and metadata of the emails.



Preprocessing

Before training the model, the raw email data undergoes preprocessing, which includes:

    Removing stop words and punctuation
    Converting text to lowercase
    Tokenization
    Vectorization using TfidfVectorizer

Model

The RandomForestClassifier is used for building the spam detection model. This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.

Key Features:

    RandomForestClassifier with [specify parameters if tuned]
    Text vectorization using TfidfVectorizer
    Train/test split for model evaluation

Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also provided to visualize the results.



Usage

To use this project:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-ml.git
cd spam-detection-ml

Install the necessary packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the notebook or script to train the model and predict email classifications.

Results

The model shows strong performance in detecting spam emails with high accuracy. It can be further improved by experimenting with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
